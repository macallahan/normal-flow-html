      <h1>Data Vizualization</h1>
        <a href="https://placeholder.com"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150"></a>
        <p>I really enjoyed creating a visualization that is both <b>simple</b> and <b>attractive</b>. I wish that I bought a few more items so that theyâ€™re would have been a wider range of data in the design, but I think it still looks good. Practicing on Inkscape did more for my learning than the tutorials did. The duplicate tool was something I found on my own, which ended up being vital to the efficiency of my project. I have never been good at drawing or graphic design at all so I am glad that this project has allowed me to expand my abilities to include using a tool like Inkscape to create something interesting.</p>
      <h2>Explained Video</h2>
        <p>Since I have <em>basically</em> no video editing experience, the Explained Video project has really allowed me to explore and utilize the basic elements of iMovie. I did most of the editing for my video project so it was both a challenge and a learning process to put together a video that is not only organized, but visually makes sense with what is being talked about in the video itself. I wish that I had a bit more graphic design experience so that I did not have to rely on powerpoint animations for visual effects. But since I did most of the work for this project I had to make do with what I was physically capable of doing.</p>
